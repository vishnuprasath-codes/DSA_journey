## ✍️ Notes

✅ 1. GFG Version – Two-Pointer Approach
Code: Returns True or False (not indices)
Why?:

In GFG problems, the question often asks “Is there a pair?”, not which one.


🕒 Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to sorting)
📦 Space Complexity: O(1) (no extra space)

---

✅ 2. LeetCode Version – Hashmap (Dictionary) Approach
Code: Returns the indices of the two elements
Why?:

In LeetCode, the question is: "Return the indices of the elements that add to target."


🕒 Time Complexity: O(n)
📦 Space Complexity: O(n) (for hashmap)
