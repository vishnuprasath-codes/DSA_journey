## ✍️ Notes

Given an array, arr of n integers, and an integer element x, find whether element x is present in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x in the array, or -1 if it doesn't exist.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.
