## ✍️ Notes

You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. The elements in the array arr[] range from  1 to n (where n is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. Your have to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 2, 3, 5]

Output: [0, 2, 2, 0, 1]

Explanation: We have: 1 occurring 0 times, 2 occurring 2 times, 3 occurring 2 times, 4 occurring 0 times, and 5 occurring 1 time.
